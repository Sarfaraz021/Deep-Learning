# Deep-Learning
This contains all the my code i have done in google colab


Certainly! Let me break down the code for you in simple terms:

The code defines a neural network model using the Keras library. This model is a sequence of layers, and it's created using the Sequential class from Keras.

The first layer in the model is a Dense layer. This layer has 10 neurons and expects input data with a shape of (784,). Each neuron in this layer will be connected to all the input features. The activation function used in this layer is the sigmoid function, which squeezes the output values between 0 and 1.

After defining the model architecture, the next step is to compile it. Compilation is necessary before training the model. In this step, you specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

The optimizer used is 'adam', which is a popular optimization algorithm.
The loss function used is 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'. This loss function is appropriate for classification problems with multiple classes, where the target values are integers.
The metric used to evaluate the model's performance is 'accuracy', which measures how often the model's predictions match the actual labels.
The last step is to train the model using the fit method. This method takes the training data (X_train_flatten) and the corresponding labels (y_train). The epochs parameter specifies the number of times the model will go through the entire training dataset during training.

Overall, this code creates a neural network model with a single dense layer, compiles it with the specified optimizer, loss function, and metric, and then trains the model using the training data for 5 epochs.
